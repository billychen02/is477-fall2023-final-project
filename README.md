# Analaysis of UCI Diagnostic Breast Cancer Data

## **Overview:**
The purpose of this repository is to reproduce the results reported of the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" by Wolberg, W., Mangasarian, O., Street, N., and Street, W. (1995), utilizing UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The data are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, indicating the traits and characteristics of the nuclei cell captured in the image. The analysis will evaluate 10 corresponding features that influenced the tumor cell analysis: radius, concavity, compactness, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The first three factors are selected for further analysis and visualization to determine the differences between benign and malignant tumors.

## **Analysis:**

We have performed random forest classification to train breast tumor data to identify and predict whether the tumor is malignant (cancer), using several correlated predicted factor, as well as observing the characteristics of tumor cells: redius, compactness, and concavity. We have found that the precision of both benign and malignant classifications are significantly high (>0.9), as well as the recall and f-1 score for both, indicating the high efficiency of the analysis. We have also found that the compactness and cocavity of both types of tumors are approximately equal, however, the radius of malignant tumor is significantly higher than that of benign, on average. This indicates the likelihood of identifying cancer tumor call by analyzing the cell's radius.

## **Licenses:**

Software licensing

We will be using the MIT License since it is one of the most adopted permissive license with standardized regulations and policies and can be applied to different types of dataset. Created by Massachusette Institute of Technology, the license is free of charge for seamless using, copying, associated documenting, sublicensing, publishing, merging, distributing and modifying the data. The reproducibility and replicatability function of this license will enable future utilization of this data and of our analysis in the future project. Additionally, the MIT also includes the limited liability feature, which providing the legal protection to the owners and reproducers of the data and software.
